	<h3>About Amaris Brown</h3>
	
	<p>I earn a living by creating custom brands and logo designs from scratch, as well as designing and building high quality websites and blogs, but I also enjoy producing the odd t-shirt graphic, illustration or character design. I pride myself in having the nerdy skills to build top notch creations online, as well as being knowledgeable in the print side of design.</p>
	
	<h3>My latest work</h3>
	
	<p>I’m forever creating design work for both myself as personal projects and as a hired gun for clients from around the world. Here’s a few of my most recent works.</p>
